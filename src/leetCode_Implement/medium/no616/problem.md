You are given a string s and an array of strings words. You should add a closed pair of bold tag <b> and </b> to wrap the substrings in s that exist in words. If two such substrings overlap, you should wrap them together with only one pair of closed bold-tag. If two substrings wrapped by bold tags are consecutive, you should combine them.

Return s after adding the bold tags.



Example 1:
````
Input: s = "abcxyz123", words = ["abc","123"]
Output: "<b>abc</b>xyz<b>123</b>"
````
Example 2:
````
Input: s = "aaabbcc", words = ["aaa","aab","bc"]
Output: "<b>aaabbc</b>c"
````

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 1000
* 0 <= words.length <= 100
* 1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
* s and words[i] consist of English letters and digits.
* All the values of words are unique.
